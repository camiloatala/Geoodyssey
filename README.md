## Planning

Why: I have had a growing travel instagram account for almost 4 years with a following of 30k. I want to invest more time in it to continue to grow the community and traction, and I believe a website will be useful to connect to users and give them more info and recommendations.

Information to Convey: Travel destinations from around the globe for the audience to get a better insight on hidden jems, adventure opportunities, best locations and best travel spots around the world. 

Target Audience: Individuals who love to travel and are interested in learning about beautiful locations around the world to add to their bucketlist.
